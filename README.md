# Implementation of MADPIE algorithm in Linux kernel

## Course Code: CS822

## Assignment: #FP4

### Overview 

Maximum and Average queuing Delay with Proportional Integral controller Enhanced (MADPIE) [1] is an extension of PIE [2], that adds deterministic packet drops at controlled intervals. This repository provides an implementation of MADPIE in the Linux kernel.
